Hi everyone, here's my project for a discussion forum about Airsoft. Airsoft is a role-playing hobby. Players dress like army soldiers and use firearm replica which use little plastic bullets of 6mm diameter. Airsoft's game are very similar to Paintball game : two or more team has to complete objectives to win the game. Most of them are played on Sunday, and the game can last all day depending of the event.

The goal of this discussion forum is to have a website to discuss about this hobby, to talk about real life event, and to have a market place.

The language used for this website is :
 - HTML
 - CSS / Bootstrap
 - Javascript
